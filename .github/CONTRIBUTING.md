Thank you for contributing ValueMax!
=========================================

Thanks for thinking about contributing to this project! This project was built a) because I wanted a tool to make these calculations and b) for learning. Now that the basic functionality is in place, I am inviting other learners to collaborate and make it even more robust. ü§ó

This is a great project for working on all skills like coding, writing documentation, writing tests, implementing 3rd party services, etc. If you don't like the sound of any of those, QA is also helpful‚Äîyou can add bug reports to the [issues](https://github.com/niamurrell/value-app/issues). All contributions welcome!

## Your First Contribution
Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series. [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Unsure where to begin contributing ? You can start by looking through these [documentation](https://github.com/niamurrell/value-app/labels/documentation) and [help-wanted issues](https://github.com/niamurrell/value-app/labels/help%20wanted)

## Where To Start

To contribute code to this project you can suggest new features, fix an existing functionality for performance or readability, work on open issues, etc. Here's a general guide for contributing:

1. **Find an issue or enhancement to work on.** You could find this by using the site or looking through the [open issues](https://github.com/niamurrell/value-app/issues).
2. **Start a discussion.** This step is optional, but if you're making a big change to the codebase or adding a new feature, it's recommended. This will give us a chance to make sure your change or feature is in scope and alignment for the app, and that your work won't conflict with existing work in progress.
3. **Check pending pull requests.** Take a look through the [pending pull requests](https://github.com/niamurrell/value-app/pulls) to make sure someone else hasn't already started working on the issue you've chosen. New pull requests are always welcome, however duplicate pull requests will not be merged. You can always add new commits to the existing pull request before it is merged‚Äîit will get automatically updated.
4. **Fork the repo.** You'll find the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of this repo. Once you're taken to your fork of the repo, use the green **Clone or download** button to open the project on your local machine. You can check the further installation requirements in the project [README](https://github.com/niamurrell/value-app/blob/master/README.md#installation).
5. **Commit your changes with meaningful commits.** Take a look through [previous commits](https://github.com/niamurrell/value-app/commits?author=niamurrell) to see how I'm defining this. Don't forget to add yourself to the list of contributors in the project README! Push commits to your fork of the repo.
6. **Submit a pull request.** üëçüëç
7. ``optional`` Make sure that all the commits in the Pull request are squashed and made into one.
In case if u dont know squashing check it [here](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-squash-multiple-commits-into-one-with-git/13231).
